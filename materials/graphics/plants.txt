Plants belong in the folder pakset/landscape/trees, even if they do not spawn naturally.
This is so all plantlife is gathered in one folder for convenience.

When using plants in your design, please check which trees are common for the intended climate in the pakset, to keep a destinct look&feel for each of them.
