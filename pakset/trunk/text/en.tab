cur_city_arc
Triumphal arch\n\nQuick, build a road underneath, before a skyscraper grows and destroys the Arch!
cur_city_basil_cathedral
Saint Basil's Cathedral\n\nThis church is officially known as "Cathedral of the Intercession of the Most Holy Theotokos on the Moat". However, it's the cities most famous landmark, and the ministry of tourism decided a shorter name is more marketable.
cur_city_cathedral
Saint George Cathedral\n\nToday, Saint George is known as a dragon slayer. In fact, he was a martyr who was tortured to death.
cur_city_church
Church
cur_city_Dohauzdium
Dohauzdium\n\nThere are rumors that the aluminum coating of the spheares acts as a shield for thought-manipulation-rays from space. It must be wrong, the TV works.
cur_city_eiffel
Eiffel Tower
cur_city_eiffel2
Eiffel Tower
cur_city_elphi
Concert Hall\n\nThe Concert Hall of the local philharmonic orchestra does provide great accustics. In winter, the roof can be used as a small ski ressort.
cur_city_gothic_cathedral
Gothic Cathedral\n\n By far the best part about any gothic building are the flying buttresses.\nOn one hand, they are the architectural marvel which distributes weights in such a way that thick walls are not needed, which in turn allows for those large windows typical for gothic architecture.\nOn the other hand, if you don't know your builders jargon, it just evokes the funniest pictures in your head. For those lacking any kind of imagination: A bunch of female asses with wings. Not the donkey kind.
cur_city_lentos
Lentos Art Museum\n\nThis modern building shelters a collection of a thousend paintings and sculptures of the century. But the nightly illumination makes it a piece of art as well
cur_city_mansion
Hounted Mansion\n\nThe magnificent mansion must have been here for generations.\nYou have probably seen it many times before, a vague familiarity overcomes you.\nBut has it always been here? \nWhy do you break out in cold sweat when you are near it? \nAnd how comes it compells you to build a bus stop right next to it, as if to... feed it?
cur_city_mosque
Mosque\n\nThis mosque was buildt for religious tolerance, one minaret is occupied by a shia muezzin, while the muezzin in the other minaret is of sunni faith. Now they compete in who can cry louder.
cur_city_museum
Museum of Pixel History\n\nThe pixel has been the denominating factor of any Simuthanians live for millennias. This glorious museum shows the history of pixel manufacturing, from stone age to modern live. A must see is a traditional pixel manufacturing site, where young and old Simuthanians are encouraged to shape their world.
cur_city_nuclear
Nuclear Non-power Plant\n\nAfter this power plant was buildt, citizens decided they didn't want to live next to a ticking time bomb. As a result, this plant is not allowed to operate and instead acts as a very expensive monument to bad planning.
cur_city_park01
Golden Knight Park\n\n Nobody can say how long the golden knight was standing in that spot. Rumors tell tales of a knight who found a fairy and wished for his armor to be of solid gold. Little did he know it would be too heavy to move, and he suffocated on the spot.
cur_city_park02
Park\n\nDid you notice yet? All plants in this park are actually fake. Buying the pre-packed park set was cheaper for the city than paying a gardener.
cur_city_planetarium
Planetarium\n\nThe planets and fixed stars projected onto the inner surface of the white cupola is one of the rare occasions Simuthanians can watch stars. Usually, this is not possible due to limitations of the isometric perspective.
cur_city_school
Middle School\n\nThis school teaches everything a young Simuthanian needs to know in his live. In English and French class, creative translation texts are written. In Math they investigate the balance of factories and vehicles. Science class revolves around the pixel as smallest part of the universe, and how attempts to split them cause such a catastrophic reaction, it would need to be pixelated. Last but not least, in sports class the high art of teleporting around corners is mastered.
cur_land_basil_church
Orthodox Church\n\nThis Church was meant to be a large cathedral for St. Basil, but the builders ran out of money prematurely. The plans still exist, perhaps one day the full cathedral will be completed after all.
cur_land_castle
Castle Keep\n\nThe keep of this castle was buildt by templers who searched for the holy grail. It's library in the western tower contains transcripts of the surfaces of countless obelisks around the worlds, with annotations added by generations of seekers.\nThough nobody ever found the grail. Perhaps it's just a legend, or the wrong game.
cur_land_pyramid
Pyramid\n\nA rare pyramid with the top intact, showing the all-seeing Eye of Sauron looking in all four directions of a compass, searching for the One Ring.
cur_land_radiotower
Broadcast pillar\n\n*brrrzzzz* *piep* Houston? *krzzzz* We ha.. a prob*piep* No more *piep*oilet pape*brzzz* *krrrrk*

mon_25years
25 Years of Simutrans!\n\nHappy birthday!
mon_anno
420 Years of of Anno 1602\n\nAnd we celebrate!
mon_at_at
AT-AT\n\nThe All Terrain Armored Transport is a quadruped mechanized infantry combat vehicle used by the Imperial ground forces. Standing over 20 meters tall with blast-impervious armour plating, these massive constructs are used as much for psychological effect as they are for tactical advantage. In this case though, it's just a statue to celebrate Star Wars Day. May the Fourth be with you!
mon_brose
Monument to Alexander Brose\n\nAlex. Brose is a world-class pixel artist, who left his mark not only in P192C. The monument shows one of the building-breeders, a machine which grows stray pixels into magnificent skyscrapers. Sadly, only Mr. Brose can operate it.
mon_coot
Cornelius Coot\n\nThe oversized statue was founded in 1952 to honor the cities founder, Cornelius Coot. It was financed by the richest inhabitant, who aimed to trump the Maharaja of Howdoyustans slightly smaller statue. The prominently placed corn reminds us of their important part in victory over spanish invaders.\n The duck was a misunderstanding. The sculptor Carl Barks and his assistent Don Rosa were only told to "Show Coot costumed as a pioneer holding cobs of corn", no further instructions or feedback.
mon_creeper
Creeper\n\nThe hollow statue provides shelter to a strange nocturnal species which excretes basic components for gunpowder and explosives. Bats are amazing.
mon_cruzer
Cruzer-Monument\n\nA monument to honor Cruzer, creator and founder of pak192.com. Withouth him, this would not be possible.
mon_cube
Rubik's Cube\n\nThis mechanical monstrosity is dedicated to the famous puzzle as well as others of it's kind, which tend to stress the mental capabilities of young and old alike. Hardly anyone notices how the sculpture is cheating.
mon_flemm
Flemmbrav Monument\n\nThis monument is dedicated to Flemmbrav, who enriched Simuthania with many things, most of which were rail-bound vehicles in all shapes, sizes and colors.\nIt represents a true masterpiece of Flemmbravian engineering. Unfortunately, the speed control is rusted so a counter-moving platform was built to keep this 'BR 61', a locomotive of the Henschel-Wegmann-Train, in place.
mon_incredible_cube
Incredible Cube\n\nA monument to honor the developers of Simutrans.
mon_isaac
Isaac Eiland-Hall Monument
mon_leartin
Monument for Leartin\n\nThis is a small interactive version of most of Leartin's fantastic landscape creations. Only the trains aren't his work, but tourists wouldn't like playing with them half as much if it wasn't for the beautyful environment.\n
mon_pokeball
Monster-Catch-Sphere\n\nThis device was used by Ash in parallel with chainsaw and shotgun to fight the army of darkness.
mon_ptm1
PappeTeeMaster monument\n\nA monument in honor PappeTeeMaster, the current pak maintainer and creator of many great buildings and vehicles, without the pak192.comic would not be so great today.
mon_rings
Monument to a wedding\n\nOriginally this monument was errected to honour some marriage, but since then, the plaque got removed, so you wouldn't know what it was about. Alas, those who need to know already know.
mon_tetris
Tetris-Monument\n\nAnd thus spoke Tetrisis, Master of Blocks, Weaver of Fate: "Line Piece!!!"
mon_tree
Jungle Tree\n\nWhen this tree was planted the authorities did not yet know that it's a protected species which can grow a few hundred meters in heights. By now the growth is managable, but give it a few hundred years and it should look down even on the LearTower.
mon_werniman
Nightly-Monument\n\nTo honor Wernieman for supplying daily nightly Simutrans versions.
mon_zumaque_1
Industrial-Monument\n\Here stands the oldes oil pump of the monopolistic and most money hungry oil company of simutrans.

Within a day she received a note from management. The doormat does not conform to the house regulations (section 7b, subsection 2) and has to be replaced by a basic gray one.
